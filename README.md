# ton-jobblips
A FiveM resource that adds a blip to the people with jobs specified in the config.
Hello guys, I am Ton and I am new in this community, this is my first release and I hope you like it :)

# How the resource works?
This resource works mainly using metatables, but don't worry, if you don't know how to edit the resource you can contact me in my dev Discord: https://discord.gg/ucAfcAdwXD

I also wrote a small documentation that explains a bit how to configure the resource to your needs: https://ton-loves-you.gitbook.io/ton-space-documentation/
